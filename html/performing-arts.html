It takes its title from the popular song by the Filipino rock band Eraserheads, which serves as the inspiration and soundtrack for the production. The musical tells a poignant and nostalgic story of friendship, love, and the struggles of young adulthood.</p>

                                <p class="subtitle is-6">The song talks about a man’s love for his childhood sweetheart who taught him how to dance. She is a classic beauty, like Paraluman, a Filipina movie star in the age of black and white, but as they grew up, they lose contact. Years later, he finds out she got pregnant but lives without a husband. Working as dishwasher, she meets her tragic death in the dark alleys of Ermita.

                                        <p class="subtitle is-6">About 30 seconds in his solo routine in the 1930 short film “Crazy House.” Tucker rolls his hips to one side. He rolls them so far that his torso tilts in counterbalance, his ankles sickle over, and his whole body bends into an S-curve of improbable depth.

He reverses the shape — first churning slowly, then at twice and four times the speed, the smaller, quicker undulations making him slither sideways on one foot. His trailing leg embroiders the glide with lariat-like curlicues, but what draws a viewer’s eye, hypnotically, is the motor: the spiraling, snaking motion of those hips.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p class="subtitle is-6">By the time he appeared in the film, Snakehips Tucker was already a name attraction in Harlem nightclubs like the Cotton Club and Connie’s Inn, and he had appeared to acclaim on Broadway and in Paris. He died on May 14, 1937, when he was just 31.

                                    The cause, as described in his obituary in The Baltimore Afro-American, was a “mysterious illness.” Neither that obituary nor those in other African-American newspapers — the mainstream press did not report the death — included many biographical facts about Tucker. Back then, obscurity wasn’t unusual for black entertainers, but the articles praised him as one of the most imitated artists of the day.
                                </p>

                                <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified">The impact of Tucker didn't end with his passing. Elvis Presley, who was born two years before Tucker passed away, most likely never saw him dance, yet he scandalized 1950s America by imitating Tucker's below-the-waist motion and making audience girls scream.

                                    Later, Michael Jackson's hallmark techniques echoed Tucker's freewheeling kicks and unwinding spins. When some hip-hop dancers saw film of Tucker, they reportedly had a startling moment of recognition: this man was performing some of their moves decades before they were.
                                    
                                    
                                    Even though these dancers didn't explicitly copy Tucker, they drew from a style that he had enhanced and made popular.</p>

                                        <p class="subtitle is-6">Silent movies, also known as silent films, were a popular form of entertainment during the early days of cinema, primarily from the late 19th century to the late 1920s. As the name suggests, silent movies are films without synchronized sound or spoken dialogue. Instead, they relied on visual storytelling, accompanied by live music, sound effects, and sometimes intertitles (text displayed on screen) to convey the narrative to the audience.</p>

                                        <p class="subtitle is-6">During the silent film era, filmmakers had to rely heavily on expressive acting, exaggerated gestures, and visual cues to convey emotions and communicate the story. The absence of dialogue allowed for a universal language of visual storytelling, making silent movies accessible to audiences worldwide regardless of language barriers.

While not a genuine silent film, it captures the spirit and essence of the genre while adding Brooks' signature humor and satirical touch.</p>

Introduced in 1955, Kermit is the pragmatic everyman protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably as the showrunner and host of the sketch comedy television series The Muppet Show and a featured role on Sesame Street, as well as in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. He served as a mascot of The Jim Henson Company and appeared in various Henson projects until 2004.</p>

                                <p class="subtitle is-6">Kermit the Frog first appeared on May 9, 1955, in the premiere of WRC-TV's Sam and Friends. This prototype Kermit was created from a discarded turquoise spring coat belonging to Jim Henson's mother and two ping pong ball halves for eyes. Initially, Kermit was a vague lizard-like creature. He subsequently made a number of television appearances before his status as a frog was established in the television special Hey, Cinderella! in 1969.His triangular-pointed collar was added at the time to make him seem more frog-like and to conceal the seam between his head and body.

                                <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified">Jim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, Sam and Friends. Henson himself described Kermit as "kind of easy-going, very likable...sometimes slightly a wiseguy."Kermit has often been referred to as Henson's "soft-spoken alter-ego.". Many of Henson's colleagues have confirmed how close and inseparable Jim and Kermit's personalities were. </p>

He created a unique blend of sports and entertainment, incorporating rock music, celebrities, and outrageously scripted matches, and in the process he molded wrestlers into child-friendly stars.

Other developments included the debut of a subscription streaming service in 2014.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle is-6">Blaine was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of a single mother, Patrice White, a teacher who was of Russian Jewish ancestry, and a father who is a Vietnam War veteran of Puerto Rican and Italian descent. When Blaine was four years old, he saw a magician performing magic on the subway. This sparked a lifelong interest for him.</p>

                                    <p class="subtitle is-6">On May 19, 1997, Blaine's first television special, David Blaine: Street Magic, aired on ABC. When asked about his performance style, Blaine explained, "I'd like to bring magic back to the place it used to be 100 years ago. On May 1, 2006, Blaine began his Drowned Alive stunt, which lasted seven days and involved a submersion in an 8 feet (2.4 m) diameter, water-filled sphere containing isotonic saline in front of the Lincoln Center in New York City.
                                    </p>

                            <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified"> During the stunt, he sustained kidney and liver damage. At the end of the stunt, Blaine attempted to free himself from handcuffs and chains after exiting the sphere. After the stunt, Blaine entered into an agreement with researchers at Yale University to monitor him in order to study the human physiological reaction to prolonged submersion.</p>
